####What is the Sharing Guidebook
The purpose of this guidebook is to help researchers build better studies. This guidebook compiles the sharing patterns from leading biomedical research studies. The main question is this: Do studies approach sharing data and results similarly? Are there are a couple patterns? Or, is each study unique and artisanal in its methods and approach to sharing?
